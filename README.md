The "Restaurant Revenue Prediction" project aims to build a predictive model to forecast the revenue of restaurants based on a variety of features such as number of customers, type of cuisine, reviews, menu price etc. This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques and data analytics to provide actionable insights that can help restaurant owners and managers make informed decisions to optimize their revenue streams.

### Objectives
1. Predict Future Revenues: Develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict future revenues for restaurants using historical data and other influencing factors.
2. Identify Key Revenue Drivers: Analyze the data to identify the main factors that significantly impact restaurant revenues.
3. Provide Strategic Insights: Offer insights and recommendations to restaurant owners on how to maximize their revenues based on predictive analysis.
